## Description
As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.
   

## Installation:
After download the project, run `npm install` in terminal. Do not forget to run it at the same directory which your downloaded folder is. Then, write `node server.js` to run! You also need robo 3T to host the database.
